## Theme
We will be examing the migration of people, specifically "economic refugees", from the cities of San Francisco and Seattle to Portland. More specifically we will look at the changes in the housing markets to these cities, the economic characteristic of people migrating between cities, and the change in the economic makeup of these cities over time. 

## Specific Questions
How has the price of housing in San Francisco, Seattle, and Portland changed over the last decade?
How have the incomes of people in San Francisco, Seattle, and Portland changed over the last decade?
How has income inequality in San Francisco, Seattle, and Portland changed over the last decade?
How do we measure income inequality?
People migrated to Portland, but what happened to the people who used to live in Portland?
What field do those migrating work in? Is there a common field?
