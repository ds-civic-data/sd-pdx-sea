SF-PDX-SEA

Lucas Williams, Josie Baker, Kyu Cho


#### Description

Examine the way people move between the cities of San Francisco, Portland, and Seattle, and the way income disparity and housing prices change as a result of out of state migration. We did this by first examining three areas of data: migration data, economic data, and housing data. We began by cleaning and tidying this data and then creating visualizations to help give us a sense of the patterns occuring. Following this we used modelling to help understand the interactions of these three areas.
